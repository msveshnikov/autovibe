## AutoVibe - Sprint 1 Feature Prioritization (Sun Mar 30 2025)

As Product Owner Agent, I have reviewed the AutoVibe project documentation and project structure to prioritize features for the next sprint.  Given the project is in its early stages, the focus will be on establishing the core functionality and a basic user experience.

### 1. Prioritized Features for Sprint 1 (Maximum 5 Items)

Here are the top 5 prioritized features for the next sprint:

1.  **Basic Frontend UI and Seed Input (`index.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`)**:
2.  **Backend API Endpoint for Loop Initiation (`app.js`)**:
3.  **Simple "Thinking Loop" Placeholder (`app.js`)**:
4.  **Basic API Key Handling (Server-Side) (`app.js`)**:
5.  **Initial Error Handling and Logging (`app.js`)**:

### 2. Explanation of Prioritized Features

1.  **Basic Frontend UI and Seed Input (`index.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`)**:
    *   **Explanation**: This is foundational for user interaction.  It involves creating a minimal UI in `index.html` with:
        *   An input field for the "seed" text.
        *   A "Run" button to trigger the loop.
        *   A designated area to display the output.
        *   Basic styling (`style.css`) to make it presentable.
        *   JavaScript (`script.js`) to capture user input and send an API request when the "Run" button is clicked.
    *   **Rationale**: Without a frontend, users cannot interact with AutoVibe. This feature is crucial for demonstrating the core concept.

2.  **Backend API Endpoint for Loop Initiation (`app.js`)**:
    *   **Explanation**: Develop a basic `/api/loop` endpoint in `app.js` that:
        *   Receives the seed input from the frontend request.
        *   Logs the received seed (for now, for debugging).
        *   Returns a simple success response (e.g., HTTP 200 OK with a message like "Loop initiated").
    *   **Rationale**: This establishes the communication channel between the frontend and backend, which is essential for triggering the core functionality.

3.  **Simple "Thinking Loop" Placeholder (`app.js`)**:
    *   **Explanation**: Implement a placeholder for the actual "thinking loop" logic within `app.js`. This could be a very basic function that:
        *   Takes the seed as input.
        *   For now, simply returns a static, pre-defined output or a very simple transformation of the seed (e.g., "Thinking loop executed with seed: [seed]").
        *   This will be replaced with the actual Gemini 2.5 integration in later sprints.
    *   **Rationale**:  This allows for end-to-end testing of the frontend-backend communication and UI display, even before the complex "thinking loop" logic is implemented. It provides a functional skeleton.

4.  **Basic API Key Handling (Server-Side) (`app.js`)**:
    *   **Explanation**: Implement a rudimentary mechanism in `app.js` to handle API keys.  For this sprint, this could involve:
        *   Reading an API key from an environment variable (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY`).
        *   Logging a message at application startup indicating whether the API key was successfully loaded.
        *   While the "thinking loop" is a placeholder, this sets the stage for secure API key management in future iterations.
    *   **Rationale**: Security is paramount. Starting with server-side API key handling, even in a basic form, is a crucial first step.  It avoids embedding keys in the frontend code.

5.  **Initial Error Handling and Logging (`app.js`)**:
    *   **Explanation**: Implement basic error handling in `app.js` to:
        *   Catch potential errors (e.g., during API key loading, request handling).
        *   Log errors to the console (for now).
        *   Return user-friendly error responses to the frontend (e.g., HTTP 500 status code with a generic error message).
    *   **Rationale**:  Robust error handling is essential for a stable application.  Even in the early stages, providing feedback when things go wrong and logging errors for debugging is important.

### 3. Suggestions for Potential New Features or Improvements (Future Sprints)

Based on the README and design considerations, here are suggestions for future features and improvements beyond the initial sprint:

*   **Gemini 2.5 Integration**: Replace the placeholder "thinking loop" with actual calls to the Gemini 2.5 API using the handled API key.
*   **Iteration Count Configuration**: Allow users to configure the number of iterations via the frontend UI and API.
*   **Real-time Output Updates (WebSockets/SSE)**: Implement WebSockets or SSE to push intermediate results and progress updates to the frontend in real-time.
*   **Result Visualization**: Enhance the frontend to display results in a more structured and user-friendly way (e.g., using cards, lists, or simple charts).
*   **Containerization**: Integrate Docker to containerize the "thinking loop" execution for security and consistency.
*   **AutoCode CLI Integration**: Explore and implement integration with the AutoCode CLI for code generation tasks within the loop.
*   **Advanced Configuration**: Add more configurable parameters for the "thinking loop" process (model selection, temperature, etc.).
*   **User API Key Input**: Allow users to input their own API keys securely through the frontend and backend.
*   **Job Management/Persistence**: Implement a system to track job status, store results, and potentially allow users to retrieve previous runs.
*   **User Accounts and Data Storage**: Introduce user accounts to manage API keys, store iteration history, and personalize the experience.
*   **Accessibility Enhancements**: Continuously improve UI accessibility to meet WCAG guidelines.
*   **Testing Framework**: Set up unit, integration, and end-to-end testing frameworks.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
*   **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement more robust logging and monitoring solutions for production.

### 4. Risks and Concerns

*   **API Key Security**:  Handling API keys securely is a major concern.  Even the "basic" handling needs to be carefully implemented to avoid accidental exposure.  Moving to user-provided API keys introduces further security complexities.
*   **Complexity of "Thinking Loop"**: Implementing a truly effective and performant "thinking loop" with Gemini 2.5 will be technically challenging and may require iterative refinement and experimentation.
*   **Containerization Overhead**:  Integrating containerization might introduce development and deployment complexity, especially if not handled efficiently.  Performance overhead from containerization should be considered.
*   **Scalability**:  The initial architecture is simple.  Scaling the application to handle multiple concurrent users and complex loops will require careful planning and potentially significant architectural changes.
*   **Frontend Complexity**: As features are added, the `index.html` and `script.js` can become complex.  Planning for frontend modularity and potentially using a frontend framework might be necessary in the future.
*   **Dependency on External APIs**: Reliance on external APIs like Gemini 2.5 and AutoCode introduces dependencies and potential points of failure.  Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms will be needed.

### 5. Recommendations for the Development Team

*   **Focus on MVP**: For Sprint 1, strictly focus on the prioritized features. Avoid scope creep and ensure these core functionalities are working smoothly.
*   **Prioritize Security**: Even in the initial stages, keep security in mind, especially regarding API key handling. Research best practices for secure environment variable management and server-side API key usage.
*   **Keep it Simple and Modular**:  Design the backend and frontend code with modularity in mind from the beginning. This will make it easier to expand and maintain the application in future sprints.
*   **Implement Basic Logging Early**: Set up a basic logging system from the start. This will be invaluable for debugging and monitoring as the project grows.
*   **Document as You Go**:  Start documenting the API endpoints, code structure, and design decisions as you develop.  This will save time and effort in the long run.
*   **Plan for Iteration**:  Recognize that AutoVibe is an iterative project.  The "thinking loop" and UI/UX will likely evolve over time.  Build in flexibility to adapt and improve based on user feedback and experimentation.
*   **Address Risks Proactively**:  Be aware of the identified risks and discuss mitigation strategies early in the development process.

By focusing on these prioritized features and considering the recommendations, the development team can make significant progress in Sprint 1 and lay a solid foundation for the AutoVibe platform.
