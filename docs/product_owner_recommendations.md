Here's a prioritized list of features for the next sprint, focusing on immediate user value and
project stability, along with explanations, suggestions, risks, and recommendations.

### 1. Prioritized Feature List (Next Sprint - Maximum 5 Items)

1.  **Enhanced Error Handling and User Feedback:** Improve error messages and status updates
    throughout the iteration process.
2.  **Basic Iteration History (Frontend View):** Implement a simple way for users to view and access
    previous iterations within the current session directly in the UI.
3.  **Clearer Status Messages & Progress Indication:** Refine status messages to be more informative
    and add a progress indicator during iterations.
4.  **Share Button Enhancement & Reliability:** Ensure the "Share Project Link" functionality is
    robust and reliably copies the correct, up-to-date URL to the clipboard.
5.  **Minor UI Polish and Responsiveness Improvements:** Address any minor UI glitches and ensure
    consistent responsiveness across different browsers and screen sizes.

### 2. Explanation of Prioritized Features

1.  **Enhanced Error Handling and User Feedback:**

    - **Explanation:** Currently, error messages might be generic or unclear. Users need more
      specific and actionable feedback when things go wrong (e.g., API key issues, model errors,
      `autocode-ai` failures, timeouts). This improves the user experience by making the tool more
      understandable and less frustrating when problems occur. Better error handling also aids in
      debugging and identifying potential issues quickly.
    - **Value:** Reduces user frustration, improves debugging, increases user confidence in the
      tool's reliability.

2.  **Basic Iteration History (Frontend View):**

    - **Explanation:** Users currently only see the latest iteration. A basic history view, perhaps
      a simple dropdown or list, would allow users to quickly browse through previous iterations
      within their current session. This allows them to compare outputs, revert to a previous state
      they liked, or simply understand the evolution of the project. This is a lightweight version
      of the "Iteration History & Management" future consideration.
    - **Value:** Improves user workflow for exploring iterations, makes it easier to find desired
      outcomes, enhances understanding of the generation process.

3.  **Clearer Status Messages & Progress Indication:**

    - **Explanation:** The current status messages are functional but could be more descriptive. For
      example, instead of just "Running iteration...", messages could indicate the stage of the
      iteration (e.g., "Generating code...", "Applying changes...", "Rendering previews..."). Adding
      a visual progress indicator (even a simple spinner with a more detailed message) during longer
      iterations can improve the perceived responsiveness and user experience.
    - **Value:** Improves user understanding of the iteration process, manages user expectations
      during longer operations, enhances the feeling of control and transparency.

4.  **Share Button Enhancement & Reliability:**

    - **Explanation:** The "Share Project Link" is a key feature for collaboration and showcasing
      results. It's crucial that this button always functions correctly and reliably copies the URL
      to the latest generated `index.html`. This includes ensuring the URL is dynamically updated
      and that the copy-to-clipboard functionality is robust across browsers.
    - **Value:** Ensures a core sharing feature works reliably, improves user satisfaction,
      facilitates collaboration and project sharing.

5.  **Minor UI Polish and Responsiveness Improvements:**
    - **Explanation:** This is about addressing any small but noticeable UI issues. This could
      include:
        - Ensuring consistent spacing and alignment of elements.
        - Checking responsiveness on different screen sizes and browsers (especially mobile).
        - Improving the visual appeal of buttons, status messages, and other UI components.
        - Addressing any reported minor UI glitches.
    - **Value:** Improves the overall user experience by making the interface more professional,
      user-friendly, and visually appealing. Enhances accessibility and usability across different
      devices.

### 3. Suggestions for Potential New Features or Improvements

Beyond the next sprint, here are some suggestions for future features, categorized for clarity:

**User Interface & Experience (UI/UX):**

- **Advanced Configuration UI:** Expose LLM parameters like temperature and max tokens in the UI for
  finer-grained control over generation.
- **Seed Templates Library:** Offer a library of pre-defined seed prompts for common use cases
  (e.g., landing page, blog post, component library) to inspire users and accelerate workflows.
- **Iteration Diff View:** Implement a visual diff view to highlight changes between consecutive
  iterations of `README.md` and `index.html`, making it easier to track evolution.
- **Download Iteration Files:** Allow users to download the files (`README.md`, `index.html`, etc.)
  from specific iterations as a zip archive.
- **Visual Iteration Browser:** Instead of a simple list, explore a more visual representation of
  iteration history, perhaps with thumbnails or more detailed previews.

**Backend & Architecture:**

- **Database Integration (MongoDB/PostgreSQL):** Migrate from file-system storage to a database for
  better scalability, querying, and user session management. This is crucial for long-term growth.
- **Robust State Management:** Implement a more formal state machine in the backend to track the
  status of each loop (e.g., `pending`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`, `stopped`) for better
  monitoring and control.
- **Session Persistence & User Accounts:** Introduce user accounts and session persistence to allow
  users to save and resume their AutoVibe projects across sessions.
- **Asynchronous Iteration Processing (Queues):** Implement a message queue (like Redis or RabbitMQ)
  to handle iteration processing asynchronously, improving backend responsiveness and potentially
  handling more concurrent users.
- **API Rate Limiting & Usage Tracking (Backend):** Implement backend rate limiting and usage
  tracking to protect against abuse and monitor resource consumption.

**Functionality & AI Integration:**

- **Model Parameter Fine-tuning:** Explore allowing users to adjust specific parameters of the
  `autocode-ai` CLI command via the UI (beyond just model selection).
- **Multi-File Project Support:** Extend `autocode-ai` and AutoVibe to handle more complex projects
  with multiple files and directories, beyond just `README.md`, `index.html`, CSS, and JS.
- **Customizable File List:** Allow users to specify which files `autocode-ai` should generate and
  iterate on.
- **Integration with Version Control (Git):** Potentially integrate with Git to allow users to
  initialize a Git repository for their AutoVibe projects and track changes more formally.

### 4. Risks or Concerns Identified

- **Dependency on `autocode-ai` CLI:** AutoVibe heavily relies on the external `autocode-ai` tool.
  Any issues, breaking changes, or lack of maintenance in `autocode-ai` could directly impact
  AutoVibe's functionality. It's important to monitor `autocode-ai` development and have contingency
  plans.
- **LLM API Costs and Rate Limits (User Responsibility):** While users bring their own API keys,
  they are still subject to the rate limits and costs associated with their chosen LLM provider. If
  users run very long or frequent loops, they might encounter API limits or unexpected charges.
  Clear communication and potentially usage guidance might be needed.
- **Security of API Key Handling:** Storing API keys in browser local storage, while convenient, has
  inherent security risks. While the README mentions "secure handling," it's crucial to continuously
  review and strengthen the security measures around API key management. Consider more robust
  client-side encryption or exploring alternative secure storage options if necessary.
- **Scalability of File System Storage:** Storing iteration results directly in the file system can
  become a scalability bottleneck as the number of users and projects grows. Moving to a database is
  a critical long-term scalability consideration.
- **Error Handling Robustness:** While error handling is prioritized for the next sprint, ensuring
  comprehensive and robust error handling across all parts of the application (frontend, backend,
  `autocode-ai` integration, API interactions) is an ongoing concern. Edge cases and unexpected
  errors need to be proactively addressed.
- **Performance of Iterative Loops:** Long iterations or complex prompts could lead to slow
  performance and potential timeouts, especially with slower LLMs or under heavy load. Optimizing
  backend processing and potentially providing user-configurable iteration limits could be
  necessary.
