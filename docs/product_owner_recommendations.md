Okay, team! Based on the current state of AutoVibe described in the `README.md`, here's the plan focusing on improving the core experience and stability for the next sprint.

### 1. Prioritized Sprint Backlog (Next Sprint - Max 5 Items)

Here are the top 5 features/improvements prioritized for the upcoming sprint:

1.  **Implement Enhanced Progress Visualization & Feedback:**
    *   **Explanation:** Currently, the user sees a spinner and iteration count. This lacks detail. We need to provide more granular feedback in the UI about what stage the loop is in (e.g., "Generating content with LLM", "Running AutoCode", "Updating files", "Iteration X completed"). This directly improves the user experience by making the process transparent.
2.  **Improve Error Handling and Display:**
    *   **Explanation:** Failures in the backend loop (LLM API errors, AutoCode CLI errors, file system issues) need to be caught gracefully and reported clearly to the user in the frontend UI. Currently, a failed request might be opaque. This is crucial for usability and debugging user issues. Include better backend logging for easier troubleshooting.
3.  **Implement Backend State Management for Loops:**
    *   **Explanation:** Introduce explicit states (`pending`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`, `stopped`) for each loop session managed by `app.js`. This provides a more robust foundation for handling concurrent requests, ensuring the "Stop" button works reliably, and preventing orphaned processes. It's a prerequisite for more advanced features like history or session management.
4.  **Add LLM Model Selection in UI:**
    *   **Explanation:** The backend `app.js` already defines two `ALLOWED_MODELS` (`gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21` and `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25`). This feature involves adding a simple dropdown or radio button selector in the `index.html` frontend to allow users to choose which model to use before starting the loop. This leverages existing backend capability to provide user choice and flexibility.
5.  **Basic Advanced Configuration - Temperature Setting:**
    *   **Explanation:** Introduce a simple input field (e.g., a slider or number input) in the UI to allow users to set the LLM `temperature` parameter before running the loop. This gives users a basic level of control over the creativity/predictability of the LLM output, enhancing the core "vibe coding" capability.

### 2. Suggestions for Potential New Features or Improvements (Beyond Next Sprint)

Based on the "Design Ideas" section and the project's nature:

*   **UI/UX:**
    *   **Iteration History Browser:** Allow users to view, compare, and potentially revert to previous versions of `README.md` and `index.html` generated during a loop.
    *   **Download Results:** Provide a button to download the contents of the session folder (final `README.md`, `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) as a zip archive.
    *   **Responsive Design:** Ensure the UI works well on smaller screens/mobile devices.
    *   **Seed Templates/Examples:** Offer pre-filled seed examples to help users get started quickly.
*   **Backend/Architecture:**
    *   **Database Integration:** Replace file-system storage with a database (like MongoDB or PostgreSQL) for better scalability, querying, and to enable features like persistent sessions.
    *   **User Authentication & Saved Sessions:** Allow users to create accounts, save their sessions (seed, configuration, results), and resume them later.
*   **Features:**
    *   **More AutoCode Configuration:** Expose more AutoCode CLI flags/options in the UI.
    *   **Sharing Functionality:** Implement a way to share a link to a specific (potentially read-only) iteration result.
*   **Operational:**
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up automated testing and deployment.
    *   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Integrate tools to monitor application health, resource usage, and errors.

### 3. Identified Risks and Concerns

*   **API Key Security:** While users bring their own keys, ensuring they are handled securely *on the server* during the loop (not logged insecurely, properly cleared from memory) is critical. Passing keys from the client needs careful consideration.
*   **Scalability (File System & Compute):** Storing each session in a separate folder on the server's file system won't scale well with many users or long histories. Running AutoCode CLI (potentially CPU/IO intensive) for multiple concurrent users could overload the server.
*   **Error Handling Complexity:** Reliably catching and interpreting errors from the external AutoCode CLI and the LLM API can be challenging.
*   **Dependency Management:** Heavy reliance on the external AutoCode CLI tool. Changes or bugs in AutoCode directly impact AutoVibe. Need clarity on how AutoCode is versioned or managed.
*   **Cost Control (User Perspective):** While users provide their *own* LLM keys, they might not anticipate how many tokens an iterative process with AutoCode could consume, leading to unexpected costs on their Google AI Studio account. Clear communication about potential usage is needed.
*   **Resource Leaks:** Ensure that stopped loops properly terminate any child processes (like AutoCode CLI) and clean up resources. Robust state management (Feature #3) will help mitigate this.

### 4. Recommendations for the Development Team

1.  **Focus on Stability:** Prioritize implementing robust error handling (#2) and state management (#3) in this sprint. This builds a more reliable foundation.
2.  **Clarify AutoCode Interaction:** Ensure a clear understanding of how `app.js` calls the AutoCode CLI, what arguments are passed (especially regarding API keys), and how its success/failure/output is determined.
3.  **Implement Incrementally:** For features like Progress Visualization (#1) and Advanced Config (#5), start simple and enhance later. Get the basic functionality working first.
4.  **Test Thoroughly:** Pay special attention to testing the loop termination ("Stop" button), error conditions, and state transitions. Consider adding basic automated tests.
5.  **Keep Security in Mind:** Be vigilant about how the user's API key is transmitted, stored (even temporarily in memory), and used, especially when interacting with external processes like AutoCode.
6.  **Communicate:** Keep the communication channel open regarding any challenges, especially around external dependencies or architectural limitations encountered.

Let's focus on making the core AutoVibe experience smoother and more reliable in this sprint!
