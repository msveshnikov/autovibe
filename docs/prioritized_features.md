# Prioritized Features

Here is a prioritized list of the top 5 features or improvements, based on the provided business
insights, focusing on maximizing impact and addressing key challenges:

**Prioritized Feature/Improvement List:**

1.  **Enhanced User Onboarding and Documentation:**

    - **Priority Rationale:** Addresses the "User Adoption and Education" risk directly. A
      user-friendly interface is mentioned, but _guiding users_ to effectively leverage seed inputs,
      understand API key integration, and grasp the platform's core value is crucial for initial
      adoption and reducing user frustration. Good onboarding and documentation are fundamental for
      any product, especially one relying on user-provided API keys which can be a point of
      friction. This unlocks the potential of the "free access tier" by making it truly accessible
      and valuable.
    - **Specific Improvements:**
        - Interactive tutorials or step-by-step guides within the platform.
        - Clear and concise documentation explaining API key setup, seed input strategies, and
          feature functionalities.
        - Tooltips and contextual help within the UI.
        - Example use cases and templates to inspire users and showcase the platform's capabilities.

2.  **Develop Core Premium Features (Idea Refinement & Collaboration):**

    - **Priority Rationale:** Directly addresses the "Maintaining Free Tier Sustainability" risk and
      the need for a clear monetization strategy. Focusing on "Advanced Idea Refinement Tools" and
      "Team Collaboration Features" builds upon the core value of "rapid idea generation" and
      elevates it to a professional-grade solution. These features cater to users who are serious
      about product development, content creation, or team brainstorming, and are more likely to
      convert to paid tiers.
    - **Specific Features:**
        - **Idea Refinement Tools:**
            - Categorization and tagging of generated ideas.
            - Idea prioritization frameworks (e.g., impact/effort matrix).
            - Idea merging and consolidation tools.
            - Ability to add notes, attachments, and context to ideas.
        - **Team Collaboration Features:**
            - Shared workspaces or projects for teams.
            - User roles and permissions for team access.
            - Comment and discussion features on ideas.
            - Real-time collaborative idea generation sessions.

3.  **Robust and Scalable Backend Infrastructure:**

    - **Priority Rationale:** Directly addresses the "Scalability and Performance" risk, which is
      critical for delivering on the "Rapid idea generation" value proposition. As user base grows
      (especially with the free tier), a stable and performant backend is essential to maintain a
      positive user experience and prevent bottlenecks. This is foundational for long-term growth
      and reliability.
    - **Specific Improvements:**
        - Load testing and performance optimization of the current infrastructure.
        - Implementation of scalable database solutions.
        - Consideration of serverless functions or container orchestration for handling fluctuating
          demand.
        - Monitoring and alerting systems to proactively identify and resolve performance issues.

4.  **Strengthen API Key Security and Management:**

    - **Priority Rationale:** Directly addresses the "Complexity of API Key Management" and "Secure
      API Key Handling" risks. Security is paramount for user trust and platform reputation,
      especially when dealing with sensitive API keys. Robust security measures are not just a
      feature but a necessity. This improvement reinforces the "Security and Consistency"
      competitive advantage.
    - **Specific Improvements:**
        - Explore more secure API key storage mechanisms (beyond potentially simple environment
          variables if currently used).
        - Implement encryption for API keys at rest and in transit.
        - Provide clear guidance and best practices to users on API key security.
        - Consider features like API key rotation or temporary key generation for enhanced security
          (if feasible and user-friendly).

5.  **Expand API Key Provider Options (Beyond Google AI Studio):**
    - **Priority Rationale:** Directly addresses the "Reliance on User-Provided API Keys" risk and
      the suggestion to "Expand API Key Options." While Google AI Studio integration is a good
      starting point, limiting the platform to a single provider restricts user choice and potential
      market reach. Supporting other popular AI model providers broadens appeal, reduces vendor
      lock-in concerns, and future-proofs the platform by allowing users to leverage different AI
      models and potentially access more specialized capabilities in the future.
    - **Specific Providers to Consider (Based on Market Relevance and User Demand - Market Research
      Needed):**
        - OpenAI API (GPT models)
        - Anthropic Claude API
        - Other emerging or specialized AI model providers relevant to idea generation and software
          development.
        - Potentially allow users to bring their own custom models/endpoints in the future for
          advanced users.

**Justification for Prioritization Order:**

- **1 & 2 (Onboarding & Premium Features):** These are placed at the top because they directly
  address the most immediate needs for user adoption, value demonstration, and monetization. Without
  good onboarding, users won't understand the platform's value. Without premium features, long-term
  sustainability is questionable.
- **3 & 4 (Backend & Security):** These are foundational for reliability, scalability, and user
  trust. A performant and secure platform is essential for retaining users and building a positive
  reputation. These are "must-haves" for a professional tool.
- **5 (API Provider Expansion):** While important for long-term growth and broader appeal, expanding
  API providers can be slightly deferred after establishing a solid foundation with onboarding,
  premium features, and a robust backend. It's a strategic next step for wider market penetration
  and reducing reliance on a single platform.

This prioritized list focuses on building a strong foundation, demonstrating value quickly to users,
and establishing a path towards sustainable growth and monetization, while also mitigating key risks
identified in the business insights.
