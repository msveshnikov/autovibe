Okay, I will update the product backlog for AutoVibe based on the provided README and project context.

Here's the updated product backlog in markdown format:

```markdown
# AutoVibe Product Backlog - Updated (Sun Mar 30 2025)

**Product Vision:** Empower users with rapid iterative thinking capabilities through a secure, accessible, and easy-to-use web platform, enabling them to explore ideas and generate unexpected outcomes at lightning speed.

**Current Project State:**
- Basic frontend (`index.html`) and backend (`app.js`) structure in place, likely functional for core loop execution.
- Project documentation (`README.md`) exists, outlining architecture, goals, and future considerations.
- Project structure shows potential separation of frontend assets into `script.js` and `style.css` folders (folders "1" and "2" are unclear and likely irrelevant).
- No database or advanced state management currently implemented.
- No CI/CD, advanced testing, or monitoring explicitly mentioned as implemented yet.

**Legend:**
- **Priority:** [High] - Must-have for initial release/MVP, [Medium] - Important for early adoption and user satisfaction, [Low] - Nice-to-have, future enhancements.
- **Type:** Feature, Enhancement, Technical Task, Bug Fix (None currently, but for future use)
- **Status:** To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done

| NF-01 | **Implement Basic UI for Seed Input & Run** | [High]   | Feature | To Do    | User should be able to input a seed idea in `index.html` and trigger the "thinking loop" via a button. Basic UI elements are needed.                                                             |
| NF-02 | **Core "Thinking Loop" Logic in Backend**  | [High]   | Feature | To Do    | Implement the core iterative logic in `app.js` based on the seed input. This is the fundamental functionality of AutoVibe.                                                                        |
| NF-03 | **Display Basic Output to User**           | [High]   | Feature | To Do    | The backend should send the generated output back to the frontend and display it in `index.html`. Basic text display is sufficient for MVP.                                                            |
| NF-04 | **API Endpoint for Loop Execution (`/api/loop`)** | [High]   | Feature | To Do    | Create a `/api/loop` endpoint in `app.js` to receive seed input and trigger the thinking loop.  Basic request/response structure using HTTP.                                                      |
| NF-05 | **"Bring Your Own API Key" Functionality** | [High]   | Feature | To Do    | Implement a mechanism for users to input their Gemini API key. Securely handle and use this key in the backend for API calls. Server-side management of API key is preferred for security.       |
| NF-06 | **Basic Error Handling**                   | [High]   | Feature | To Do    | Implement basic error handling in both frontend and backend to gracefully manage issues like API failures, invalid input, etc. Display user-friendly error messages.                                |
| NF-07 | **Loading State Indicators**               | [Medium] | Feature | To Do    | Implement visual loading indicators (e.g., spinners) in the frontend to provide feedback to the user while the backend is processing the loop. Improves user experience.                             |
| NF-08 | **Input Validation (Client-side)**        | [Medium] | Feature | To Do    | Add client-side validation in `script.js` to ensure the seed input is in the correct format (if any format constraints are needed) and provide immediate feedback to the user.                    |
| NF-09 | **Input Validation (Server-side)**        | [Medium] | Feature | To Do    | Implement server-side validation in `app.js` to validate the seed input and any configuration parameters received via the API. Crucial for security and data integrity.                       |
| NF-10 | **Frontend Refactoring (CSS & JS Separation)** | [Medium] | Enhancement | To Do    | Separate CSS into `style.css` and JavaScript into `script.js` files instead of inline in `index.html`. Improves code organization and maintainability.                                        |
| NF-11 | **Implement Basic Result Visualization**   | [Medium] | Feature | To Do    | Improve the display of results beyond basic text. Consider using cards, lists, or formatted output to make results easier to read and understand.                                                  |
| NF-12 | **Backend Modularity**                    | [Medium] | Enhancement | To Do    | Refactor `app.js` into modules (e.g., `api.js`, `loop-runner.js`) to improve code organization and maintainability as the backend logic grows more complex.                                  |
| NF-13 | **Responsiveness for Different Screen Sizes** | [Low]    | Enhancement | To Do    | Ensure the UI in `index.html` is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes (desktop, mobile, tablet) using CSS media queries.                                                      |
| NF-14 | **Accessibility (WCAG Compliance - Initial)** | [Low]    | Enhancement | To Do    | Begin implementing basic accessibility best practices in `index.html` and related frontend code to start working towards WCAG compliance. Focus on semantic HTML and ARIA attributes initially. |
| NF-15 | **Basic Documentation - API Specification** | [Low]    | Technical Task | To Do    | Document the `/api/loop` endpoint (request/response format, parameters) in the `README.md` or a separate API documentation file.                                                                 |
| NF-16 | **Unit Tests for Backend Logic**          | [Low]    | Technical Task | To Do    | Write unit tests for key backend functions in `app.js` (especially the "thinking loop" logic) to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.                                                      |
| NF-17 | **Configuration Management (Environment Variables)** | [Low]    | Technical Task | To Do    | Implement environment variable configuration for `app.js` (e.g., for port, API keys if managed server-side). Use a `.env` file for local development.                                     |
| NF-18 | **Implement Rate Limiting (API Endpoint)** | [Low]    | Technical Task | To Do    | Implement basic rate limiting on the `/api/loop` endpoint in `app.js` to protect against abuse and ensure service stability.                                                                 |
| NF-19 | **Explore Containerization Strategy**       | [Low]    | Technical Task | To Do    | Investigate and prototype containerization options (Docker or simpler process isolation) for the "thinking loop" execution in `app.js`.  Focus on security and consistency.                   |
| NF-20 | **Investigate Real-time Feedback (WebSockets/SSE)** | [Low]    | Technical Task | To Do    | Research and prototype implementing WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time progress updates and result streaming from backend to frontend.                                  |
| NF-21 | **Explore State Management Options**       | [Low]    | Technical Task | To Do    | Research and evaluate different state management options for job status and results (file-based, SQLite, Redis, etc.) for future scalability and persistence.                                 |
| NF-22 | **Setup Basic CI/CD Pipeline**           | [Low]    | Technical Task | To Do    | Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment to a staging environment.                                                                     |

## Updated Priorities for Existing Items

* **All items are currently considered "New Features & User Stories"** as this is likely the initial backlog creation based on the project description.

---

## Removed or Completed Items

* **No items removed or completed yet.** This is the starting point.

---

## Additional Notes & Comments

* **Focus for the next Sprint/Iteration:** Prioritize items marked as **[High]** and some **[Medium]** priority items to achieve a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The MVP should demonstrate the core "thinking loop" functionality with a basic UI and essential features.
* **API Key Security is Paramount:** Ensure the "Bring Your Own API Key" feature is implemented with robust security measures. Avoid storing keys client-side. Server-side management using environment variables or secure vault is recommended for later stages.
* **Iterative Development:**  This backlog is a starting point and will be refined iteratively as development progresses and we gather feedback.
* **Technical Debt Awareness:**  While focusing on MVP, be mindful of technical debt and plan for refactoring and improvements (like modularity, testing, etc.) in subsequent iterations.
* **"Use AutoCode" Integration:**  The "Use AutoCode" goal is implicitly included within the "Core 'Thinking Loop' Logic in Backend" feature. The implementation details will need to address how and when AutoCode CLI is leveraged.
