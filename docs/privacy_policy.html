    <h1>Privacy Policy for AutoVibe</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [Insert Date of Last Update - e.g., July 26, 2024]</p>

    <p>Welcome to AutoVibe! This Privacy Policy explains how AutoVibe ("we," "us," or "our") handles information when you use our application and associated services (the "Service").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Handle</h2>
    <p>AutoVibe is designed to minimize the collection of personal data. Here's what information is involved when you use the Service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>API Keys:</strong> The Service requires you to provide your own API key from a third-party Large Language Model (LLM) provider (e.g., Google AI Studio for Gemini models). This key is transmitted to our backend server solely for the purpose of proxying your requests to the LLM provider during an active generation session. <strong>We do not store your API key persistently on our servers after your session ends.</strong> You are responsible for the security and management of your own API key according to the terms of the provider.</li>
        <li><strong>Seed Input:</strong> The initial text or data ("seed") you provide to start the generation process is sent to our backend server to initiate the iterative loop.</li>
        <li><strong>Generated Content:</strong> The content (text, code, data) generated by the LLM during the iterations, including intermediate results like `README.md` and `index.html` files, is processed and temporarily stored on our server's file system within a unique folder created for your session.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Data:</strong> We temporarily store data related to your active session (e.g., session identifier, iteration count, configuration parameters) on our server's file system to manage the generation process. This data is typically associated with the unique session folder.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data (Non-Personal):</strong> We may collect anonymous technical information about your interaction with the Service, such as server request logs (IP address, request time, user agent), solely for operational purposes like monitoring server load, diagnosing technical problems, and improving the Service. This data is not linked to specific user identities in our core application logic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>The information handled by AutoVibe is used exclusively to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide and operate the core functionality of the Service (running LLM iterations based on your seed).</li>
        <li>Process your requests to the third-party LLM via your provided API key.</li>
        <li>Temporarily store and display the generated content during your active session.</li>
        <li>Manage the state of your generation loop (e.g., running, stopped).</li>
        <li>Monitor and improve the performance and stability of the Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Generated content and session data are stored temporarily on our server's file system within unique, session-specific folders. These folders and their contents are typically intended to be transient and may be automatically cleaned up after a period of inactivity or based on server maintenance policies.</p>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical measures to protect the data handled by our Service during transmission and temporary storage. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We do not permanently store your API keys or seed inputs beyond the scope of an active session.</p>
    <p>You are responsible for securing your own API key and for the nature of the seed input you provide.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>AutoVibe interacts with the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>LLM Providers (e.g., Google AI):</strong> Your API key and prompts (derived from your seed and subsequent iterations) are sent to the LLM provider you configure. Your interaction with these services is governed by their respective privacy policies and terms of service.</li>
        <li><strong>AutoCode CLI:</strong> The backend may invoke the AutoCode CLI tool as part of the iteration process. Data processed during these steps may be handled according to AutoCode's operational logic.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party services.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Session data and generated content stored on the file system are temporary. We do not guarantee long-term storage or retention of this data. API keys are not retained by our Service after the session processing requiring them is complete.</p>

    <h2>6. User Rights</h2>
    <p>As we do not collect personally identifiable information or maintain user accounts, traditional data access or deletion rights requests are generally not applicable. Data associated with a session is temporary. Stopping a session ceases further processing and generation for that session.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or a higher age threshold where applicable). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
