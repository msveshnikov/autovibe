# Documentation for `app.js`

## Overview

`app.js` is the backend server application built using Node.js and Express.js. It serves as the core
logic for interacting with language models, specifically Google Gemini Flash, and potentially other
tools via command-line interfaces (CLI), as indicated by the placeholder for `callAutoCodeCLI`.

This file is responsible for:

- **Serving static frontend files:** It serves `index.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`, and other
  static assets located in the same directory as `app.js`, enabling a client-side application to
  interact with the backend.
- **Handling API requests:** It provides an API endpoint (`/api/loop`) to trigger a "thinking loop"
  process. This loop iteratively calls the Google Gemini Flash model to generate content based on a
  user-provided seed.
- **API Key Management:** It handles API key authorization via Bearer tokens in the `Authorization`
  header for the `/api/loop` endpoint.
- **Error Handling:** It includes error handling for API calls, input validation, and server errors.
- **Placeholder for CLI Integration:** It contains a placeholder function `callAutoCodeCLI`
  suggesting potential integration with command-line tools like `autocode`.

**Project Structure Context:**

Based on the provided project structure, `app.js` resides at the root level, alongside frontend
files like `index.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`, and configuration files like `.prettierrc` and
`package.json`. The directories `1` and `2` with their own sets of frontend files and `README.txt`
are present, suggesting potential different versions or experiments within the project. The code in
`app.js` writes to directory `3`, indicating a possible output directory for the `callAutoCodeCLI`
function.

In summary, `app.js` is the central backend component that orchestrates the interaction between the
frontend, language models (Gemini), and potentially CLI tools, forming the server-side logic of the
application.

## Functions

### `callGeminiFlash(seed, apiKey)`

This asynchronous function calls the Google Gemini Flash language model to generate content based on
the provided seed text.

**Parameters:**

- `seed` (string): The input text prompt provided to the Gemini model. This serves as the starting
  point for content generation.
- `apiKey` (string): The API key required to authenticate with the Google Generative AI service.

**Return Value:**

- `Promise<string>`: A Promise that resolves with the generated text content from the Gemini model
  if successful.
- `Promise<Error>`: A Promise that rejects with an `Error` object if the API call fails, the API key
  is invalid, or if the Gemini model returns an error or no content.

**Errors:**

- **'API Key is required to call the Gemini model.'**: Thrown if the `apiKey` is not provided.
- **Gemini API execution failed: Invalid API Key. Please check your key.**: Thrown if the provided
  `apiKey` is invalid.
- **Content generation blocked due to: ...**: Thrown if the Gemini model blocks content generation
  due to safety concerns, including details about the block reason and safety ratings.
- **No content generated by the model.**: Thrown if the Gemini model returns a successful response
  but does not generate any content.
- **Received unexpected response format from Gemini API.**: Thrown if the response from the Gemini
  API does not conform to the expected structure.
- **Gemini API execution failed: ...**: A generic error message for other issues encountered during
  the API call, including the specific error message from the API.

**Usage Example:**
